Excel Dashboard for sales data

This Excel workbook contains three sheets:
1. Sales data sheet, which I cleaned and formatted.
2. Calculations sheet, which I created to store some calculations, named ranges, pivot tables... etc. All to be used to create the dashboard.
3. Dashboard sheet: An interactive dashboard presenting key information about the sales data.


Here's a snap of the dashboard:
